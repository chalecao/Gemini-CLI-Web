## **1\. Introduction to Gemini CLI**

The Google Gemini Command Line Interface (CLI) represents a significant advancement in AI-augmented developer tooling, providing direct access to Google's powerful Gemini models within the familiar terminal environment. Positioned as Google's strategic response to similar offerings like Anthropic's Claude Code, this open-source AI agent is engineered to understand complex codebases and facilitate a wide array of development tasks through natural language interaction.\[1, 2, 3, 4, 5\]

### **1.1 Overview and Core Capabilities**

At its core, the Gemini CLI functions as an intelligent assistant that integrates seamlessly into a developer's workflow. Its primary purpose is to enhance productivity and streamline development processes by leveraging artificial intelligence directly from the command line. The tool's capabilities extend across several critical areas of software development:

* **Editing and Refactoring:** The CLI can automatically improve and simplify code structures, guided by AI-driven suggestions, thereby enhancing code quality and maintainability.\[1, 5\]  
* **Bug Detection and Fixing:** It possesses the ability to identify errors within code and propose intelligent fixes, accelerating the debugging process.\[1, 6, 5\]  
* **Code Understanding:** Developers can prompt Gemini to summarize architectural designs, explain the roles of various modules, or map data flows within a codebase, providing rapid insights into complex systems.\[1, 6, 5\]  
* **Test Generation:** The CLI can auto-generate pytest test cases, contributing to improved code reliability and increased confidence in continuous integration (CI) pipelines.\[1, 6, 5\]  
* **Documentation Support:** It aids in creating structured markdown documents, changelogs, and even drafting GitHub issue replies directly within the terminal, simplifying documentation efforts.\[1, 6, 5\]  
* **Versatile Utility:** Beyond its coding prowess, the Gemini CLI serves as a versatile local utility, capable of content generation, problem-solving, deep research, and general task management, making it a comprehensive AI assistant for various professional needs.\[2, 3, 7, 8\]

### **1.2 Underlying Principles (ReAct Loop, Context Window, Token Management)**

The operational foundation of the Gemini CLI is built upon a Reason and Act (ReAct) loop. This architectural pattern enables the AI agent to dynamically plan and execute complex tasks by leveraging a combination of its built-in tools and external Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers.\[2, 3, 4, 8\] This agentic capability allows it to tackle intricate use cases, from fixing elusive bugs to creating entirely new features and improving test coverage.

A significant feature supporting its advanced capabilities is a massive 1 million token context window. This extensive context capacity allows the CLI to process and interact with large codebases effectively, enabling deep analysis and generation that extends beyond the limitations of smaller context models.\[4, 6, 7, 8\] It is also important to note that the usage quotas for Gemini CLI are shared with Gemini Code Assist agent mode, indicating a unified resource consumption model across Google's developer AI offerings.\[2, 3, 4, 8\]

The combination of the open-source nature of Gemini CLI and its deep integration into Google's commercial "Code Assist" product line, complete with shared quotas, reveals a sophisticated strategic approach by Google. This is not merely the release of a standalone tool; rather, Gemini CLI is positioned as a primary interface for developers to access and consume a broader suite of Google's AI services. The open-source aspect is designed to foster community contributions, accelerate iteration cycles, and build trust among developers. Concurrently, the tight integration with Code Assist and the shared quota system establish a clear pathway for commercialization and enterprise adoption within the Google Cloud ecosystem. This dual strategy aims to cultivate developer loyalty and drive the consumption of Google's AI infrastructure, effectively transforming the CLI into a powerful gateway to their cloud-based AI solutions. This approach underscores how Gemini CLI serves as a strategic entry point for Google to acquire and retain developers within its AI and cloud ecosystem, leveraging open-source principles for broad adoption while providing commercial offerings for scalability and enterprise readiness.

### **1.3 Integration with VS Code**

Recognizing the prevalence of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) in modern software development, a subset of Gemini CLI functionality is directly accessible within the Gemini Code Assist chat feature in VS Code.\[2, 3, 4, 7\] This integration ensures that developers can leverage the power of Gemini's AI capabilities without leaving their preferred IDE, further streamlining their workflow and minimizing context switching.

## **2\. Installation and Initial Setup**

To harness the capabilities of the Gemini CLI, a straightforward installation and authentication process is required. This section details the necessary prerequisites, various installation methods, and the flexible authentication pathways available to users.

### **2.1 Prerequisites**

Before installing the Gemini CLI, certain foundational software components must be in place:

* **Node.js and npm:** Node.js version 18 or higher is a mandatory requirement, with v22 being the recommended version for optimal compatibility and performance. The installation typically involves using NVM (Node Version Manager), which provides a flexible means of managing multiple Node.js versions on a single system. Verification of a successful installation can be performed using node \-v, nvm current, and npm \-v commands.\[1, 4, 7, 5, 9\]  
* **Git:** Git must be installed and properly configured on the system. The Gemini CLI extensively utilizes Git commands to interact with and understand codebases, making it an indispensable prerequisite for its core functionalities.  
* **Python:** While not a direct requirement for the core Gemini CLI, certain Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers or community-developed tools that extend Gemini CLI's capabilities may rely on specific Python versions. For instance, the diversioteam-gemini-cli-mcp server requires Python 3.10-3.13. Users planning to integrate such extensions should verify their Python environment.

### **2.2 Installation Methods**

The Gemini CLI offers flexible installation options to suit different user preferences and environments:

* **Global Installation:** The most common and recommended method is to install the CLI globally using Node Package Manager (npm): npm install \-g @google/gemini-cli. This command makes the gemini executable available from any directory in the terminal.\[1, 4, 7, 8, 5, 10, 9\]  
* **Run Without Global Install:** For quick testing, one-off tasks, or environments where global installations are restricted, the CLI can be executed directly using npx: npx https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli or npx @google/gemini-cli.\[1, 4, 5, 10, 9\]  
* **Accessing the CLI:** Regardless of the installation method, once the setup is complete, the interactive Gemini CLI session can be launched by simply typing gemini in the terminal.\[1, 4, 7, 8, 5, 9\]

### **2.3 Authentication Methods**

Authentication is a critical step to enable Gemini CLI to interact with Google's AI models. The CLI provides multiple authentication pathways to cater to diverse user needs and usage scenarios:

* **Personal Google Account (OAuth):** Upon the first launch, the Gemini CLI typically prompts for authentication using a personal Google account via OAuth. This method offers generous free-tier usage limits, including up to 60 model requests per minute and 1,000 requests per day, making it an accessible entry point for individual developers and small-scale experimentation.\[1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 5, 9\]  
* **API Key:** For users requiring higher usage limits, access to specific models, or more granular control, an API key generated from Google AI Studio can be utilized. This key can be made available to the CLI by setting it as an environment variable (export GEMINI\_API\_KEY="Your\_API\_Key") or by creating a .env file. A .env file located at \~/.gemini/.env provides global access, while one at ./.gemini/.env is specific to a project.  
* **Vertex AI:** For seamless integration with Google Cloud projects and enterprise-grade deployments, authentication via Vertex AI is supported. This typically involves configuring GOOGLE\_CLOUD\_PROJECT and GOOGLE\_CLOUD\_LOCATION environment variables, allowing the CLI to operate within the context of a specific Google Cloud project. The GOOGLE\_APPLICATION\_CREDENTIALS environment variable, often set via gcloud auth application-default login, is also recognized for Google Cloud authentication.  
* **Switching Authentication:** The /auth slash command provides the flexibility to switch between different authentication methods dynamically within an active CLI session, adapting to changing requirements without needing to restart the application.\[1, 5, 10, 9\]

This tiered authentication strategy is a deliberate design choice by Google to accommodate a broad spectrum of users, from individual developers exploring AI capabilities to large enterprises integrating AI into their core workflows. The generous free tier serves as a low-friction entry point, encouraging widespread adoption and familiarization with the tool. As user needs evolve or as specific enterprise requirements emerge—such as centralized billing, fine-grained access control, or integration with existing cloud infrastructure—users can seamlessly transition to API keys or Vertex AI. This approach minimizes initial barriers to entry while simultaneously providing a clear and well-defined upgrade path for commercial and enterprise-level consumption of Google's AI services. Effectively, this system aids in converting casual users into potential paying customers, thereby driving the adoption and utilization of Google's broader AI infrastructure.

### **2.4 Project Initialization and Context Loading**

The Gemini CLI is designed to be highly aware of the project environment in which it operates, enabling more relevant and accurate AI assistance.

* **Starting a New Project:** To initiate a new development project from scratch, users can navigate into a newly created directory and simply run the gemini command. Once initialized, the CLI can be prompted to populate the new directory with code based on natural language instructions.\[1, 5\]  
* **Working with Existing Projects:** For existing codebases, the CLI can be launched directly from within the project's root directory (e.g., a cloned Git repository). Alternatively, if the CLI is launched from a different location, the /path command can be used to manually load a local project by providing its full directory path.\[1, 5\]  
* **gemini init:** Running gemini init within the root folder of a project is a recommended practice. This command helps the Gemini CLI to comprehensively understand the project's code structure, which in turn allows the AI to provide more contextually relevant and precise responses.

The CLI's inherent "project awareness" is a critical enabler for its effectiveness as an AI coding agent. By automatically inferring context from the current working directory, respecting .gitignore files to filter irrelevant or sensitive content, and providing explicit mechanisms like gemini init and GEMINI.md for defining project-specific instructions, the AI can ground its responses in the specific nuances of a given codebase. This deep contextual understanding significantly reduces the need for verbose prompts describing the project structure, leading to AI-generated code, bug fixes, or explanations that are remarkably more accurate, relevant, and actionable. This design fosters a seamless "AI-as-a-team-member" experience, as the AI behaves as if it is already intimately familiar with the project's layout, conventions, and requirements. The strong emphasis on project context management is fundamental to the Gemini CLI's ability to deliver highly relevant and accurate AI assistance, transforming it from a generic large language model (LLM) interface into a deeply integrated development partner.

## **3\. Gemini CLI Commands: A Comprehensive Reference**

This section provides an exhaustive reference to the commands, flags, built-in tools, and context-aware syntax that define the operational landscape of the Google Gemini CLI. It is crucial for expert users to understand these elements for effective and advanced interaction.

### **3.1 Interactive (REPL) vs. Non-Interactive Mode**

The Gemini CLI offers distinct modes of operation tailored for different use cases:

* **Interactive Mode (REPL):** This is the default mode, initiated by simply running gemini in the terminal. It establishes a conversational session where users can engage with the AI in a turn-by-turn dialogue, asking questions and receiving responses dynamically. This mode is ideal for exploratory tasks, debugging, and iterative development.\[8, 5, 10\]  
* **Non-Interactive Mode:** For single-shot prompts, scripting, or integration into automated workflows, the CLI can be invoked in a non-interactive manner. A prompt is passed directly using the \-p flag (e.g., gemini \-p "Summarize the main points of the attached file. @./summary.txt"). This mode is particularly well-suited for automation within continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines or for batch processing.  
* **Piping to the CLI:** Content can also be piped directly into the CLI for processing, offering another avenue for automated input (e.g., echo "Count to 10" | gemini).\[5, 10\]

### **3.2 Top-Level Commands and Core Flags**

The primary command for interacting with the Gemini CLI is gemini, which serves as the entry point for both interactive sessions and various direct operations.

* **gemini:** The fundamental command to launch the interactive CLI session.\[1, 4, 7, 8, 5\]  
* **gemini auth login:** Initiates the authentication process, guiding the user through connecting their Google account or API key.  
* **gemini-mcp setup:** A utility command used to verify the setup and configuration of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, ensuring external tools are correctly integrated.  
* **gemini review:** Designed for automated code review, this command can be configured with options such as \--staged-files to review changes in the Git staging area, \--all\_files to review the entire codebase, and \--format to specify the output format (e.g., checklist). This command is highly valuable for integration into pre-commit hooks to enforce coding standards.\[6, 11\]  
* **gemini docs:** Facilitates the generation of documentation. It supports various options for specifying input and output directories, desired formats (e.g., markdown), and modes for auto-updating or watching for changes.\[6, 11\]  
* **gemini completion:** This command is used to enable tab-completion functionality for Gemini CLI commands within the user's shell (e.g., Bash or Zsh), significantly improving command-line efficiency.

It is important for expert users to be aware of a naming collision in the broader tooling ecosystem. The research material includes commands such as gemini update and gemini test. These commands, however, belong to a separate visual regression testing tool also named "Gemini" (often referred to as gemini-testing) and are not part of Google's AI-powered Gemini CLI. Furthermore, an archived Go-based tool for Gemini LLMs, eliben/gemini-cli, also exists and explicitly warns of its deprecation due to the release of the new official Google CLI. For this report, the focus remains exclusively on Google's AI-powered Gemini CLI. The presence of multiple tools sharing identical or similar names can lead to significant user confusion and misapplication of information. For an expert-level analysis, it is critical to explicitly differentiate the intended "Gemini CLI" (Google's AI agent) from other tools. The fact that some sources might conflate these highlights the necessity for precise terminology and contextual clarity in technical documentation. An expert user must be cognizant of these distinctions to avoid unproductive efforts with irrelevant tools or troubleshooting issues specific to the wrong application. This naming conflict in the open-source ecosystem underscores the importance of rigorous contextualization in expert documentation to ensure clarity and prevent the misapplication of information, especially for tools with overlapping functionalities or names.

### **3.3 Command-Line Flags and Options (-- commands)**

Beyond the primary commands, various flags and options provide granular control over the CLI's behavior:

* **\-m, \--model \<model\>:** This flag allows users to explicitly specify which Gemini model should be used for a given interaction (e.g., gemini-2.5-pro).  
* **\-d, \--debug:** Enabling this flag activates verbose debug output, which is invaluable for troubleshooting issues, understanding the AI's internal processes, and diagnosing unexpected behavior.  
* **\--yolo:** This powerful flag automatically approves all tool calls made by the AI without requiring explicit user confirmation. While highly beneficial for automation and non-interactive scripts, its use carries significant security implications, as it bypasses a critical safeguard against unintended or potentially destructive actions.  
* **\--checkpointing:** When enabled, this flag instructs the CLI to save a project snapshot before initiating any file modifications. This allows users to utilize the /restore command to revert changes if necessary, providing a safety net for AI-driven code alterations.  
* **\--sandbox:** This option runs tool execution within a secure sandbox environment, requiring Docker or Podman. It provides an isolated execution context, mitigating risks associated with potentially harmful AI-generated commands.  
* **\--all\_files:** This flag ensures that all files within the current context are included for processing, which is particularly useful for comprehensive codebase analysis or batch operations.  
* **\-p "\<prompt\>":** As noted, this flag is used in non-interactive mode to pass a direct prompt to the CLI, facilitating single-shot queries and scripting.\[6, 8, 5, 10\]  
* **\--help:** Displays general help information and a list of available commands.  
* **\--version:** Displays the current version of the Gemini CLI.

The \--yolo flag and the autoAccept setting (configurable in settings.json for safe, read-only tool calls) directly address a common user frustration: the repetitive manual confirmations required for AI-suggested actions. While these options significantly enhance automation and convenience, they introduce a critical trade-off between efficiency and security. \--yolo, by auto-approving *all* tool calls, bypasses a crucial safeguard, potentially allowing the AI to execute unintended or even destructive commands without explicit human oversight. autoAccept, limited to "safe, read-only" actions, represents a more cautious approach.\[10\] This tension highlights the inherent challenge in designing AI agents: balancing the desire for seamless automation with the necessity of human control and safety. Expert users must carefully weigh these risks, especially when deploying Gemini CLI in automated pipelines or sensitive environments, potentially relying on sandboxing (--sandbox) or strict prompt engineering rather than blanket \--yolo usage. The design of auto-approval features in AI agents reflects a fundamental tension between maximizing automation and ensuring human oversight and security; expert users must understand this trade-off to implement safe and effective AI-driven workflows.

### **3.4 Built-in Tools**

The Gemini CLI's core functionality is powered by a suite of built-in tools. These tools are often invoked implicitly by the AI based on the user's natural language prompt, but understanding them allows for more precise prompt engineering.

| Tool Name | Command Example/Invocation | Description | Key Capabilities/Purpose |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| WriteFile | write-file | Creates new files with specified content. | Code generation, documentation creation.\[6, 8, 11\] |
| Shell | \!npm test, \!ls \-al | Executes shell/system commands directly within the CLI. Entering \! alone toggles persistent shell mode. | Running tests, navigating directories, executing scripts.\[6, 8, 5, 11, 10\] |
| WebFetch | @web-fetch https://api.example.com/data | Fetches and analyzes content from web URLs. | Analyzing API responses, extracting data from web pages.\[1, 4, 6, 7, 8, 11\] |
| GoogleSearch | @search What are the latest security best practices for Node.js? | Performs Google searches to ground AI responses with real-time information. | Researching topics, validating best practices, finding solutions.\[3, 6, 8, 5, 11, 9\] |
| ReadFolder | ls | Lists files and folders in a specified directory. | Codebase exploration, understanding directory structure.\[6, 8, 11\] |
| ReadFile | read-file | Reads the full content of a single file. | Summarizing files, analyzing code, extracting information.\[6, 8, 11\] |
| ReadManyFiles | read-many-files | Reads content from multiple files, often matching a glob pattern. | Batch analysis of code files, aggregated summaries.\[6, 8, 11\] |
| FindFiles | glob | Searches for files by pattern (e.g., all config.json files). | Locating specific file types or configurations across a project.\[6, 8, 11\] |
| SearchText | grep | Searches for specific text within files (e.g., "TODO comments"). | Code auditing, finding specific code patterns or comments.\[1, 4, 6, 7, 8, 11\] |
| Edit | edit | Applies code changes via diffs, typically requiring user approval. | Automated code modifications, bug fixes, refactoring.\[6, 8, 11\] |
| SaveMemory | memoryTool | Stores facts or preferences during a session for improved consistency in AI responses. | Maintaining context, enforcing coding styles, remembering project rules. |
| terminal | (Implicit) | General interaction with the terminal environment. | Underlying execution of shell commands.\[1, 4, 7\] |
| file write | (Implicit) | Writes content to files. | General file creation and modification.\[1, 4, 7\] |

*Note: The terminal and file write tools are often implicitly used by the AI as part of its reasoning and acting process, rather than being directly invoked by a user command.*\[1, 4, 7\]

### **3.5 Context Commands (@ syntax)**

The @ symbol is a powerful mechanism for providing context-aware input to the AI. When used in a prompt, it allows users to reference specific files or directories, directing the AI's attention to relevant parts of the codebase. For instance, @src/ can be used to refer to an entire source directory, while @src/components/Button.jsx can pinpoint a specific component file.\[3, 6, 7, 5, 11, 12\] The CLI supports auto-completion for files and folders when the @ symbol is typed, enhancing usability.\[3, 7, 12\] Crucially, the CLI respects .gitignore files, ensuring that irrelevant or sensitive files are not inadvertently included in the AI's context, which is vital for security and efficiency.\[5, 10\]

The \! prefix for direct shell command execution and the @ syntax for referencing files and directories are more than just convenient shortcuts; they are foundational elements of the Gemini CLI's design philosophy, aimed at deeply integrating AI capabilities into the developer's existing terminal workflow. By allowing direct shell command execution, Gemini CLI effectively acts as a "super-terminal," minimizing context switching between the AI agent and the underlying operating system. Similarly, the @ syntax, coupled with intelligent file system awareness, empowers the AI to operate directly on the codebase, transforming it into an active participant in code analysis, generation, and modification. This seamless interweaving of AI intelligence with traditional command-line operations significantly reduces friction, enabling complex "multi-step workflows" and automating tasks that would otherwise require manual orchestration. This integrated approach positions the developer as a highly efficient orchestrator of AI-powered processes, enhancing overall productivity. The intuitive integration of shell and file system interaction through \! and @ transforms the terminal into an AI-augmented environment, streamlining development workflows and enhancing developer productivity by reducing context fragmentation.

### **3.6 Custom Commands**

For advanced users and specific project needs, the Gemini CLI supports the creation of custom commands. These commands are defined using TOML files and can be stored either globally (\~/.gemini/commands/) or on a project-specific basis (\<project\>/.gemini/commands/).\[5, 10\] This extensibility allows developers to tailor the CLI's behavior to unique workflows, such as generating specific types of unit tests or automating highly specialized tasks. An example might involve a custom command to generate a Jest unit test based on a provided description.\[5, 10\]

## **4\. Slash Commands: In-Session Control and Management (/ commands)**

Within an active Gemini CLI session, various slash commands (/) provide granular control over the AI's context, conversation flow, and utility functions. These commands are essential for managing the interactive experience and optimizing AI performance.

### **4.1 Core Slash Commands**

A set of fundamental slash commands enables users to manage the AI's operational state and access critical information:

* **/memory:** This command suite is dedicated to managing the AI's conversational context and persistent memory.  
  * **/memory show:** Displays the combined context that the AI is currently operating with, including information derived from all loaded GEMINI.md files. This offers transparency into the AI's understanding of the project.\[2, 3, 4, 7, 13, 5, 10\]  
  * **/memory refresh:** Reloads all GEMINI.md files, ensuring that the AI's context is updated with the latest project-specific instructions or information.\[5, 10\]  
  * **/memory add:** Allows users to explicitly inject specific instructions or contextual information into the AI's memory during a session, guiding its future responses and behavior.\[3, 7, 5, 12\]  
* **/stats:** Provides key metrics related to the current session, including total token usage, any savings achieved from cached tokens, and the overall session duration. This command is crucial for monitoring usage efficiency and understanding the resource consumption of AI interactions.  
* **/tools:** Lists all tools available to the Gemini CLI, encompassing both its built-in functionalities and any tools exposed via configured Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. This helps users understand the full range of actions the AI can perform.  
* **/mcp:** Specifically lists all configured MCP servers and the individual tools they make available to the CLI. This is essential for understanding the extended capabilities provided by external integrations.  
* **/auth:** Enables users to change the current authentication method (e.g., switching between a personal Google account and an API key) within the active CLI session.  
* **/help:** Displays general help information and a comprehensive list of available commands.  
* **/quit:** Exits the Gemini CLI interactive session.

The extensive suite of context management commands, such as /memory show, /memory refresh, /memory add, and /compress, underscores that effective interaction with large language models, especially in complex, multi-turn coding scenarios, is fundamentally about managing the AI's working memory.\[7, 5, 10\] The ability to explicitly add information to memory, inspect the current context, refresh it, or compress it to save tokens directly addresses the inherent challenges of token limits and maintaining conversational coherence over extended sessions. This design indicates that Google recognizes context management as a critical user-facing feature, not merely an internal LLM mechanism. Inadequate context management can lead to issues like "wasted context window" and excessive token consumption, which these commands aim to mitigate, thereby optimizing for both cost and accuracy. The robust context management features in Gemini CLI are essential for overcoming LLM limitations, enabling more precise AI guidance, reducing operational costs, and improving the overall user experience in complex, long-running AI-assisted tasks.

Furthermore, the inclusion of the /stats command, which provides real-time feedback on "session token usage and savings," is a subtle yet powerful feature.\[7, 13, 5, 10\] This command reflects an understanding of developer needs that extend beyond mere functionality, encompassing operational transparency and resource management. For developers working with AI models, where usage often correlates with cost and performance, having immediate visibility into token consumption is invaluable. It allows users to monitor their usage efficiency, identify patterns of high token consumption, and make informed decisions to optimize their interactions, especially in scenarios with rate limits or token-based billing. This feature empowers users to manage their resources effectively, contributing to a more cost-efficient and performant AI-assisted development workflow.

### **4.2 Conversation Management**

Beyond core operational commands, the CLI provides tools for managing the conversational flow:

* **/compress:** Replaces the entire chat context with a summarized version. This is particularly useful in long conversations to prevent hitting token limits, ensuring continued interaction without losing the essence of the discussion.\[5, 10\]  
* **/copy:** Copies the last AI response to the clipboard, facilitating easy transfer of generated code or text to other applications or documents.\[5, 10\]  
* **/clear:** Clears the terminal screen and the current conversational context, effectively allowing the user to start a fresh interaction without exiting the CLI application.\[5, 10\]  
* **/chat save \<tag\>:** Saves the current conversation with a specified tag, enabling users to revisit and resume specific discussions at a later time.\[5, 10\]  
* **/chat resume \<tag\>:** Resumes a previously saved conversation by its tag, restoring the full context of that interaction.\[5, 10\]

### **4.3 Project State Management**

For managing changes made by the AI to the local codebase, the CLI includes a project state management command:

* **/restore:** This command allows users to list or restore a project state checkpoint. It is dependent on the \--checkpointing flag being enabled during the CLI's invocation, providing a crucial undo mechanism for AI-driven file modifications.\[5, 14, 10\]

### **4.4 Customization and Feedback**

The CLI also offers commands for personalizing the user experience and providing feedback:

* **/theme:** Allows users to change the visual theme of the CLI interface, catering to personal aesthetic preferences.  
* **/bug:** Provides a direct mechanism to file an issue or bug report about the Gemini CLI, contributing to its ongoing improvement and stability.

## **5\. Configuration Settings and Advanced Customization**

The Gemini CLI offers extensive configuration options, allowing users to tailor its behavior to individual preferences, project requirements, and security policies. These settings are managed through a hierarchical system of settings.json files, environment variables, and .env files.

### **5.1 Configuration Precedence**

Understanding the order in which configuration parameters are applied is crucial for effective customization. The precedence, from highest to lowest, is as follows:

1. **Command-Line Arguments:** These are the most specific overrides. Any argument passed directly when launching the CLI, such as gemini \--checkpointing, will always take precedence over settings defined elsewhere for the current session.\[5, 14, 15\]  
2. **Environment Variables:** These are system-wide or session-specific settings. Examples include GEMINI\_API\_KEY and GOOGLE\_CLOUD\_PROJECT, which override file-based settings.\[5, 14, 15\]  
3. **Project (Workspace) Settings file (.gemini/settings.json):** These settings are defined for a specific project directory and override personal user settings.\[5, 14, 15\]  
4. **User Settings file (\~/.gemini/settings.json):** These are your personal default settings that apply globally across all your projects.\[5, 14, 15\]  
5. **Gemini CLI Default Values:** These are the hardcoded, out-of-the-box settings that the CLI ships with, such as the default model being "gemini-2.5-pro".\[14\]

### **5.2 The \~/.gemini Directory: Your Personal AI Configuration Hub**

The \~/.gemini directory, located in your user's home directory, serves as the central hub for global Gemini CLI configurations, custom commands, and extensions. This directory is typically created upon the first launch of the Gemini CLI or can be manually set up. It allows for a highly personalized and extensible AI development environment.

Within the \~/.gemini directory, you will find or can create the following key files and subdirectories:

* **settings.json (Global User Settings):**  
  * **Location:** \~/.gemini/settings.json \[5, 14\]  
  * **Purpose:** This file stores your personal preferences that apply across all your projects. It's where you define your preferred theme, default selectedAuthType (e.g., "oauth-personal"), or a preferredEditor like "vscode".\[14\] Upon first launch, this file is created with initial choices, and its values can be updated dynamically using CLI commands like /theme or /auth.\[14\] You can also enable checkpointing globally here.\[14\]  
  * **Example Configuration:**  
    JSON  
    {  
     "selectedAuthType": "oauth-personal",  
     "theme": "Default",  
     "preferredEditor": "vscode",  
     "checkpointing": {"enabled": true}  
    }

    \[14\]  
* **.env (Global Environment Variables):**  
  * **Location:** \~/.gemini/.env \[5, 14\]  
  * **Purpose:** This file is ideal for storing sensitive information like your GEMINI\_API\_KEY or other environment variables that you want to be available globally across all your Gemini CLI sessions without exposing them directly in your shell history or public configuration files.\[5, 14\] The CLI automatically loads variables from this file.  
  * **Loading Order:** The CLI prioritizes .env files in the current working directory, then searches upwards to the project root or home directory, and finally checks \~/.env.\[14\]  
* **commands/ (Custom Commands Directory):**  
  * **Location:** \~/.gemini/commands/ \[5, 19, 20, 21\]  
  * **Purpose:** This directory allows you to define custom commands using TOML files, creating personal shortcuts for frequently used or complex prompts.\[5, 20\] These commands are available globally across all your projects.\[20\]  
  * **Naming and Namespacing:** The command name is derived from its file path relative to its commands directory. Subdirectories create namespaced commands, with path separators (/ or \\) converted to colons (:). For example, \~/.gemini/commands/test.toml becomes /test, and \~/.gemini/commands/git/commit.toml becomes /git:commit.\[20\]  
  * **Content:** Custom command TOML files must include a prompt field (the actual prompt sent to Gemini) and can optionally include a description.\[20\] They support argument substitution ($ARGUMENTS), file inclusion (@file\_path), and shell command output expansion (\!shell\_command) within their templates, enabling highly dynamic and reusable workflows.\[21\]  
* **extensions/ (Extensions Directory):**  
  * **Location:** \~/.gemini/extensions/ \[2, 5, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28\]  
  * **Purpose:** This directory is where you can create and manage extensions to add new functionalities to the Gemini CLI.\[5, 23\] Each extension is a subdirectory containing a gemini-extension.json file, which configures MCP servers, tools, and context files specific to that extension.\[5\]  
  * **Loading and Precedence:** The CLI loads extensions from both global (\~/.gemini/extensions/) and workspace-level (\<workspace\>/.gemini/extensions/) locations.
